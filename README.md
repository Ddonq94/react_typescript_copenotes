# Getting Started with Copenotes React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app has 2 tabs, one for creating new users and one for vieweing all users and the messages they have received.

The backend (details in the repo Readme) [https://github.com/Ddonq94/backend_nodejs_copenotes](https://github.com/Ddonq94/backend_nodejs_copenotes) has to be running locally for this to work.

Both can be setup on localhost using the instructions in their respective repo ReadMe files (`npm start`)

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
